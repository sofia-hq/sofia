**NOMOS** is a framework for building advanced LLM-powered assistants with structured, multi-step workflows. It helps you create sophisticated AI agents through configurable flows, tools, and integrations — making complex agent development accessible from no-code to full-code approaches.

```bash
pip install nomos[cli]
```

To learn more about NOMOS, check out [the documentation](docs/md/). If you're looking for quick prototyping, try our [Playground](https://nomos.dowhile.dev/playground) for drag-and-drop agent creation.

## Why use NOMOS?

NOMOS helps developers build sophisticated AI agents through structured workflows and configurable components, making complex agent development accessible to teams of all skill levels.

Use NOMOS for:
- **Multi-step agent workflows**. Create complex, stateful interactions with step-by-step flow definitions, each with specialized tools and intelligent routing between conversation states.
- **Rapid prototyping to production**. Start with our Playground for no-code prototyping, then seamlessly transition to YAML configuration or full Python implementation as your needs evolve.
- **Tool ecosystem integration**. Leverage your existing Python functions, or integrate with CrewAI, LangChain tools, and any Python package through our unified tool system with automatic documentation generation.
- **Production-ready deployment**. Built-in session management, error handling, monitoring, and Docker deployment options make it easy to scale from prototype to production.

## NOMOS Ecosystem

While NOMOS can be used standalone, it integrates with a growing ecosystem of tools and services designed for agent development:

- **[Playground](https://nomos.dowhile.dev/playground)** - Design and prototype agent flows with our drag-and-drop interface. Perfect for rapid iteration and collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.
- **[TypeScript SDK](support/ts-sdk/README.md)** - Full-featured client library for web and Node.js applications, enabling seamless integration of NOMOS agents into your frontend applications.
- **[Docker Base Images](docs/md/deployment.md#docker-base-image)** - Pre-configured containers for rapid deployment with built-in support for Redis, PostgreSQL, and monitoring integrations.
- **[CLI Tools](docs/md/cli-usage.md)** - Comprehensive command-line interface for agent development, testing, and deployment with `nomos init`, `nomos run`, `nomos train`, `nomos serve`, `nomos test`, `nomos schema`, and `nomos --version` commands.
